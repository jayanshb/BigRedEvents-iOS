Big Red Events

An app that centralizes all the information about the events on Cornell's campus. Currently, the app allows Cornellians to know what events are happening on North Campus. Using add, one can add events according in particular locations. This information is stored on our API on a google cloud virtual machine and can be accessed when one is looking for events. Users can explore different dorms in the home tab in a tabular form, or can just search for dorms on the search bar. Users can also favourite dorms to have easy access to events in those dorms, under the favourites tab! When viewing the events, users can search for particular events, choose filters (like food, games, music, movie etc.) or simply see the table of events. BRE does not yet accomplish all of our envisioned features. We plan to expand and include the rest of the campus, allowing users to RSVP to events, check in to events, add events to their google calendar, send invites to friends for events, find event locations on google maps and also see who all are attending the event along with other interesting features!
